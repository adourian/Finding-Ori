# Finding-Ori

🎯 **Objective:** The goal of this project is to find candidates for the DnaA boxes of Salmonella Enterica. 

📁 **Files:** The main file in this project is 'Finding_DnaA_Box.ipynb', in which we explore the genome of Salmonella Enterica (file: 'Salmonella_enterica.txt') to find
candidates for the DnaA Box. The other python files are supporting functions which are called in the notebook.

📊 **Datasets:** The datasets folder is not very important and was mostly used to verify the functions were working properly while building them.
