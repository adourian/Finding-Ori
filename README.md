# Finding-Ori

This goal of this project is to find candidates for the DnaA boxes of Salmonella Enterica. 

This repository contains a number of functions created to solve this problem. 

These functions are used in a jupyter notebook on the Salmonella Enterica genome to find candidates for the DnaA boxes.
